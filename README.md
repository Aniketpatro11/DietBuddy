## Overview  

**DietBuddy** is an AI-powered dietary assistant that helps users make smarter nutrition choices.  
It looks up your **age, diet preferences, health goals, genetic traits, and real-time health metrics** to create personalized diet suggestions.  

Unique to DietBuddy:  
- **Blockchain-based food traceability**: scan a product → instantly view **certifications, trust scores, and batch details**.  
- **Genomics Integration (CRISPR/23andMe-like data)**: upload your **raw genetic data (CSV)** and DietBuddy will interpret it (e.g., lactose intolerance, folate metabolism, caffeine metabolism, obesity/diabetes risk markers, etc.).  
- **Dynamic Profile Update**: A button labeled **“Update in Profile”** lets you automatically sync genetic findings to your user profile. If different reports contain new traits, they are **added dynamically** and stored in a **custom notes section**.  
- **IoT Smartwatch/Health Band Integration**: connect your wearable device to stream **real-time BP, glucose, heart rate, and other biomarkers** into DietBuddy. Based on live data, DietBuddy sends **instant food recommendations & warnings** (e.g., “⚠️ Your BP is high, avoid salty food today”).  

Together, these features make DietBuddy a **next-gen AI nutritionist** that combines **genetics, AI, IoT, and blockchain trust**.
